# SEAL 911 Code of Conduct

1. We Are Accountable
2. We Act Ethically
3. We Protect Our Information and Assets

## 1. We Are Accountable

We are aware that many people entrust us with sensitive information. If we abuse this trust in any way, we lose our purpose of being a trustworthy point of contact for incidents. So let us act accordingly and take this responsibility seriously.

## 2. We Act Ethically

We do not exploit our information advantage in any way to gain a personal, commercial, or other malicious advantage. Our aim is always to achieve the best possible result for the victim. Misuse of information is not tolerated and will result in the removal from SEAL 911. **Simply put: Don't be a dick!**

## 3. We Protect Our Information and Assets

In one sentence: We handle information carefully, as you would expect from security professionals. Do NOT share information outside of the [SEAL 911 Telegram bot](https://t.me/seal_911_bot) unless it is needed for the incident. We should always assume that information is confidential unless we have knowledge that the victim or another party has made the information public or has the right to release it.
